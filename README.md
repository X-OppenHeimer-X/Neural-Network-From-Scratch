# Neural-Network-From-Scratch

A hands on project by rhyme where the main aim was:

a)How to implement a neural network model from scratch using TensorFlow.
b)Solving a multi-class classification problem using the neural network implementation.

In this project , gradient descent algo was implemented with help of tensorflow automatic differentiation.
The project finally concluded with implementation of the above to solve a multi-class classification problem.
